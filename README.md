# Scrolling Text
5 different methods for coding scrolling text with plain HTML, HTML &amp; CSS and finally HTML + CSS + JS

## Plain HTML Scrolling Text

Simply add a tag around the text to create a scrolling effect. This tag offers a few interesting parameters among which:

- direction — can be: left, right, up, or down
- scrollamount - the speed of the scroll text
- loop — how many times should the scrolling repeat

***NOTE:*** The is a deprecated HTML tag, so I’d recommend restrain in using it for modern web projects.
